This repository is the home for all the code involved in the Rasrotor project. This includes any code on the Raspberry Pi's, any code for our website, and any other code we eventually include. 

For more information regarding the Rasrotor project, we will soon have a website up and running. In the mean time, contact Udit Gupta(ug28@cornell.edu) or Michael Whittaker(mjw297@cornell.edu).
