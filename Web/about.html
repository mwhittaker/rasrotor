    <h1> What Is The Rasrotor? </h1>
    <p> Meet <a href="contact.html#michael">Michael</a>. One day, his parents asked him if he wanted a Raspberry Pi. Gleefully, he responded in the affirmative. Enter <a href="contact.html#udit">Udit</a>. He was planning on buying a quadrotor. Individually, they had pretty nifty things going for them, but together, they had the potential to make something truly awesome.
    <p> Part Raspberry Pi, part quadrotor, the Rasrotor is the birthchild of two computer scientists' imagination. Like any offspring of imagination, the Rasrotor is more idea than reality. That is, Udit and Michael aren't yet sure what the Rasrotor will become. They envision a Raspberry Pi strapped to the underbelly of a quadrotor, but haven't decided on much else. What they are sure of is that the Rasrotor project will be as much an application of what they know as it will be an exploration into what they don't. As their ideas for the Rasrotor solidify, so too will their understanding of networking, command line interfaces, web design, ...the list goes on!</p> 
    <p> If you have any ideas, advice, critiques, or words of wisdom for Udit or Michael, feel free to send them an <a href="contact.html">email</a>. Any and all input is welcome! </p>

    <h1> Where Is Your Code? </h1>
    <p> Michael and Udit are both supporters of the Open Source Movement. All their code, from what goes on the Pi's to what goes on the web, can be found over on <a href="http://github.com/mwhittaker/rasrotor" target="_blank">Michael's github</a>. Michael and Udit are always looking to hone their craft, so they encourage you to review and critique their code. </p>
