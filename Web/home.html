    <p class="blog-post">Today we released the humble www.rasrotor.com to the web at large! Needless to say, we couldn't be more proud.</p>
    <p class="blog-post">From day one, Udit and I decided that the overarching philosophy of the Rasrotor Project was to learn. Owning cool things, whether it be a top of the line quadrotor or an outrageously powerful web template, would have to play second fiddle to acquisition of knowledge. A wonderful example of this philosophy is this website itself.</p>
    <p class="blog-post">Everything on this website was built from the ground up. Every word, every heading, every pixel of every ribbon, and every Polaroid preview was born in an empty document and typed lovingly into existence. For a while, Udit and I were considering implemented some pretty sleek and sexy front-end frameworks, like <a class="blog-link" href="http://github.com/twitter/bootstrap" target="_blank">bootstrap</a>. Doing so would have made our website mouth-wateringly beautiful, but we both felt that implementing an existing framework wouldn't accurately reflect what we had learned, and we both agreed that the acquisition and exhibition of knowledge needed to reign supreme. That being said, view this website not as a competitor in the sexiest front-end competition, but rather view it as blank canvas smeared with the knowledge of two young Computer Scientists. Clearly, it's not the most advanced website on the internet, but as a product of five days of learning html, css, and javascript, rasrotor.com makes Udit and I prouder than can be.</p>
    <p class="blog-post">With that spiel out of the way, let me walk you through what went into making rasrotor.com. The first two or three days after we began outlining the site were spent solely on learning html, css, and javascript. We combed through the tutorials on <a class="blog-link" href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools</a> and tried to absorb as much information as possible. We plastered rasrotor.com with examples and fragments of ideas until it was a collage of html experiments. After we were confident in the basics, we commented out all our experiments and began work on the actual website to be. The first thing implemented was the navigation bar at the top of the screen. Next up was the banner above the navigation bar which required that I learn some rudimentary GIMP. Next, we added text to the about section and the contact section. We formatted the contact section and sewed in some easter eggs, then tackled the home page. Learning how to make ribbons from CSS alone was challenging, but ended up looking beautiful. The next major addition was the Polaroid preview in the media section that took a lot of trial and error to put together. We spellchecked our blogs, added more media links, added a couple more easter eggs, and the website was good to go.</p> 
    <p class="blog-post">Reflecting on the past five days of intense web designing, I almost can't believe we did it. Going from knowing nothing to crafting this site was a daunting challenge, but it was time well spent. Now with the website up on its feet, our attention turns toward coding the Pi's. Udit also got a little camera happy, so enjoy the pics!</p>

    <p class="blog-post">Today we played around with Git. We created a practice repository to see how cloning, pushing, pulling and merging worked. At first we were very confused but with the help of graphs and google, we began to understand what was happening behind the scenes.  After playing around with Git for an hour we finally had a practice repository with basic code that both of us could manage.</p>
		<p class ="blog-post"> After learning how  to navigate Git, we took down the practice repository and made a new one - rasrotor.  All the code, including the html for the website was put here. Soon we'll be able to collectively work on writing code for mud!!  </p>

    <p class="blog-post">After discovering one of the power adapters was broken, Udit and I got around to testing all the goodies in our care package. Apart from some issues trying to change the default language on our Pi's from en_GB to en_US, things went swimmingly. This included booting up our second Raspberry Pi, deliciously named Buko (a Filipino coconut custard pie), and the third Raspberry Pi which will soon make it's way to California into the awaiting arms of my dad.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">We also began learning html and created the skeleton of our soon to be website. Topics included headings, paragraphs, links, images, video, style, formatting, the list goes on. Knowing nearly nothing about html and CSS, besides what I taught myself over Winter Break, and knowing absolutely nothing about javascript, php, etc, I will definitely have my hands full crafting a website throughout the week. To make things even more challenging, I am imposing on myself that I do all my editing in vim. Why? I think all up and coming computer scientists should be familiar with at least one command line text editor. Also, the syntax highlighting is just so beautiful. Heck, it may even make me a better speller. Hopefully by the end of Spring Break, we will have created something that passes for a website and let it loose to the web at large.</p>

    <p class="blog-post">Today we ssh-ed into the default pi user!! With the Raspberry Pi connected to our home internet via ethernet and the TV for a display, the ssh process was a breeze. We also ran ssh-keygens to ease the ssh process. After playing around with the usernames (and being stumped by the differences between adduser and useradd), we finally added the user *mud. We are still thinking of a name for the second Raspberry Pi.</p>
    <p class="blog-post">Next, we connected mud to a router which was also connected via ethernet to a computer. This allowed us to ssh into the pi w/o internet access. From now on we will try to always use ssh to work with mud.</p>
    <p class="blog-post">Finally, we added mud to the sudo group allowing it to sudo. We also implemented Euclid's algorithm in C on mud.</p>

    <p class="blog-post">After arriving in New Jersey for the week, we spent the first night powering up the RasPi's. At first nothing worked. Sitting in the basement, we started to panic...Trouble shooting what could be wrong, we quickly learned that the power adapter was broken - thank god the Pi itself was okay. </p>
	<p class ="blog-post"> Now that the Pi's were working, we connected them to the big, flat screen TV in the basement. After configuring the Pi we spent a few hours playing games, admiring the GUI, and writing "Hello World" in C, C++, and Python. Seeing the GUI and playing games on the RasPi was possibly one of the coolest things ever - so much power in something no bigger than your wallet...  Project Rasrotor is online.</p>
    <p class="blog-post">Stay tuned for more exciting news...</p>

    <p class="blog-post">Like Christmas in March, our Raspberry Pi care package arrived in the mail today from my loving parents. It includes 3 Raspberry Pi
    s, 3 power chords, 3 SD cards, 3 cases, 2 keyboards, and 2 mice. One Pi, one power chord, and one SD card will be shipped back to my dad in California so he can take a byte of the Pi. If you ever wonder where my inner Computer Scientist comes from, you've found your answer.</p>
    <p class="blog-post"> We unboxed the Pi's and other goodies to make sure the tech treats survived their cross country trek. Academic masochists though, both Udit and I are rather bogged down in class work and won't have time to take a byte of the Pi's until the start of Spring Break this Friday. I'll be staying with Udit at his home in New Jersey for an eventful week of Rasroting.</p>

    <p class="blog-post">Hello and welcome to the first blog post of the Rasrotor project! For a brief description of the project, head on over to the "About" section.</p>
    <p class="blog-post">My name is Michael Whittaker. I'm a Computer Scientist and a member of the Class of 2016 at Cornell University. Most of my time, outside of classwork, is spent on CUAir, the project team I belong to, and on consulting an introductory Computer Science course at Cornell, CS 1110. One day, my wonderful parents gave me a call and asked if I was interested in getting a Raspberry Pi. I didn't really know what a Raspberry Pi was, but after a cursory Googling, I knew enough to differentiate it from the dessert. A fan of computers, linux, and now Pi, I happily accepted my parents' offer.</p>
    <p class="blog-post">My friend's name is Udit Gupta. He's an Electrical and Computer Engineering major, also in the Class of 2016 at Cornell. He too is a part of CUAir and was planning on purchasing a quadrotor to fly recreationally. Working with planes all day can make a hobbyist out of the best of us.</p> 
    <p class="blog-post">Being friends, we were shooting the breeze when talk turned towards Raspberry Pi's and quadrotors. Quick-witted lads, we realized that a quadrotor and Raspberry Pi combination would be a beautiful thing.</p>  
    <p class="blog-post">Fast forward to today. We're not really sure what the "Rasrotor Project" will entail, but we foresee a Raspberry Pi attached to the underside of a quadrotor, flying around and generally being awesome some time in the future. We'll start a website to document the project and to satisfy our inner bloggers. We'll make our code open source to be as transparent as possible. Most importantly, we'll learn a lot along the way.</p>    
    <p class="blog-post">From mastering git to becoming familiar with the linux command line to researching computer networking, the Rasrotor project is, above all else, a learning experience. An autonomous, barrel-rolling, Raspberry Pi powered supercopter would be a wonderful takeaway, but even if our quadrotor and pi's both crash miserably, we'll still mark it as a win if we learn something new.</p>
    <p class="blog-post">With nothing behind us and a long journey ahead of us, consider this blog post a christening of the bountiful adventures to come! Cheers for now. </p>
