    <h1> About </h1>
    <p> The Rasrotor project is the brainchild of Udit Gupta and Michael
    Whittaker. What exactly is the Rasrotor? It will be a combination of a 
    quadrotor and a Raspberry Pi. What exactly will the Rasrotor accomplish?
    Well, Udit and Michael aren't really sure yet. The Rasrotor project is as
    much an application of what they know as it is an exploration into what they
    don't. Far from well versed in fields such as web design or networking,
    Udit and Michael are learning the ropes as they go along. Without a clear
    idea of what's ahead, all they can do is hope for the best and learn a lot along
    the way. <br> <br>
    If you have any ideas, advice, or words of wisdom for these two brave souls,
    feel free to send them an email. Any and all input is welcome! </p>
