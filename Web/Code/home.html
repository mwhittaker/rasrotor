    <p class="blog-post">Today we played around with Git. After cloning, pushing, pulling and merging we were able to setup a rasrotor repository. At first we were very confused about how Git worked. We created a practice repository to see how it came together. After an hour of palying around with Git we were finally about to have a practice repository with bsic code that we both editted and could successfully manage.</p>
		<p class ="blog-post"> After being able to navigate Git, we took down the practice repository and made a new one - rasrotor.  All the code, including the html for the website was put here. Soon we'll be able to collectively work on writing code for mud!!  </p>

    <p class="blog-post">After discovering one of the power adapters was broken, Udit and I got around to testing all the goodies in our care package. Apart from some issues trying to change the default language on our pi's from en_GB to en_US, things went swimmingly. This included booting up our second Raspberry Pi, deliciously named Buko (a Filipino coconut custard pie), and the third Raspberry Pi which will soon make it's way to California into the awaiting arms of my dad.
    </p>
    <p class="blog-post">We also began learning html and created the skeleton of our soon to be website. Topics included headings, paragraphs, links, images, video, style, formatting, the list goes on. Knowing nearly nothing about html and CSS, besides what I taught myself over Winter Break, and knowing absolutely nothing about javascript, php, etc, I will definitely have my hands full crafting a website throughout the week. To make things even more challenging, I am imposing on myself that I do all my editing in vim. Why? I think all up and coming computer scientists should be familiar with at least one command line text editor. Also, the syntax highlighting is just so beautiful. Heck, it may even make me a better speller. Hopefully by the end of Spring Break, we will have created something that passes for a website and let it loose to the web at large.</p>

    <p class="blog-post">Today we connected the RasPi to a TV and ssh-ed into the default pi user. We were also ran ssh-keygens to ease the ssh process. After playing around with the usernames - differences between adduser and useradd, we finally added the user *mud. The second raspi is to be named....</p>
    <p class="blog-post">We connected mud to a router which was also connected via ethernet to a computer. This allowed us to ssh into the pi w/o internet access. From now on we will try to always use ssh to work with mud.</p>
    <p class="blog-post">Finally, we added mud to the sudo group allowing it to sudo. We also implemented Euclid's algorithm in C on mud.</p>

    <p class="blog-post">The first time we powered up the Raspberry Pi nothing worked.  We quickly learned that the power adapter was broken - thank god the Pi itself was okay. After configuring the Pi we spent a few hours playing games, admiring the GUI, and writing "Hello World" in C, C++, and Python.</p>

    <p class="blog-post">Like Christmas in March, our Raspberry Pi care package arrived in the mail today from my loving parents. It includes 3 Raspberry Pi
    s, 3 power chords, 3 SD cards, 3 cases, 2 keyboards, and 2 mouses. One Pi, one power chord, and one SD card will be shipped back to my dad in California so he can take a byte of the pi. If you ever wonder where my inner computer scientist comes from, you've found your answer.</p>
    <p class="blog-post"> We unboxed the Pi's and other goodies to make sure the tech treats survived their cross country trek. Academic masochists though, both Udit and I are rather bogged down in class work and won't have time to take a byte of the Pi's until the start of Spring Break this Friday. I'll be staying with Udit at his home in New Jersey for an eventful week of Rasroting.</p>

    <p class="blog-post">Hello and welcome to the first blog post of the Rasrotor project! For a brief description of the project, head on over to the "About" section.</p>
    <p class="blog-post">My name is Michael Whittaker. I'm a computer scientist and a member of the Class of 2016 at Cornell University. Most of my time, outside of classwork, is spent on CUAir, the project team I belong to, and on consulting an introductory computer science course at Cornell, CS 1110. One day, my wonderful parents gave me a call and asked if I was interested in getting a Raspberry Pi. I didn't really know what a Raspberry Pi was, but after a cursory Googling, I knew enough to differentiate it from the dessert. A fan of computers, linux, and now pi, I happily accepted my parents' offer.</p>    
    <p class="blog-post">My friend's name is Udit Gupta. He's an Electrical and Computer Engineering major, also in the Class of 2016 at Cornell. He too is a part of CUAir and was planning on purchasing a quadrotor to fly recreationally. Working with planes all day can make a hobbyist out of the best of us.</p> 
    <p class="blog-post">Being friends, we were shooting the breeze when talk turned towards Raspberry Pi's and quadrotors. Quick-witted lads, we realized that a quadrotor and Raspberry Pi combination would be a beautiful thing.</p>  
    <p class="blog-post">Fast forward to today. We're not really sure what the "Rasrotor Project" will entail, but we foresee a Raspberry Pi attached to the underside of a quadrotor, flying around and generally being awesome some time in the future. We'll start a website to document the project and to satisfy our inner bloggers. We'll make our code open source to be as transparent as possible. Most importantly, we'll learn a lot along the way.</p>    
    <p class="blog-post">From mastering git to becoming familiar with the linux command line to researching computer networking, the Rasrotor project is, above all else, a learning experience. An autonomous, barrel-rolling, Raspberry Pi powered supercopter would be a wonderful takeaway, but even if our quadrotor and pi's both crash miserably, we'll still mark it as a win if we learn something new.</p>
    <p class="blog-post">With nothing behind us and a long journey ahead of us, consider this blog post a christening of the bountiful adventures to come! Cheers for now. </p>
